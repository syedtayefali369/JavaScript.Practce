  - [ ] Switch cases
  - [ ] Loops (for, while, forEach)
- [ ] **Functions**
  - [ ] Function declarations vs expressions
  - [ ] Arrow functions
  - [ ] Parameters & arguments

### Phase 2: Intermediate (Weeks 3-4)
- [ ] **Arrays & Methods**
  - [ ] map, filter, reduce
  - [ ] find, some, every
  - [ ] slice, splice, concat

  - [ ] Object destructuring
  - [ ] Spread operator
  - [ ] Template literals
- [ ] **DOM Manipulation**
  - [ ] Selecting elements
  - [ ] Event handling
  - [ ] Dynamic content updates

### Phase 3: Advanced (Weeks 5-6)
- [ ] **Asynchronous JavaScript**
  - [ ] Callbacks
  - [ ] Promises
  - [ ] Async/Await
- [ ] **Closures & Scope**
  - [ ] Lexical scoping
  - [ ] Factory functions
  - [ ] Module pattern
- [ ] **ES6+ Advanced**
  - [ ] Classes & OOP
  - [ ] Modules (import/export)
  - [ ] Optional chaining

## 🛠️ Projects Roadmap

## 🎯 Learning Tips

### 1. **Consistency Over Intensity**
- Code for 1-2 hours daily
- Regular commits to GitHub
- Daily problem solving

### 2. **Practice Methodology**
```javascript
// Follow this pattern for each concept:
// 1. Understand the theory
// 2. Write simple examples
// 3. Build small projects
// 4. Solve coding challenges
// 5. Review and refactor
3. Project-Based Learning
Start with simple projects

Gradually increase complexity

Document your learning

# 🎯 Learning Strategy Tips

## 1. **Start with the Right Mindset**
- **Don't rush** - Understanding > Completing
- **Embrace confusion** - It's part of learning
- **Build consistently** - 1 hour daily > 7 hours weekly

## 2. **Practical Learning Approach**
```javascript
// For each new concept, follow this pattern:

// STEP 1: Understand
// Read documentation and watch tutorials

// STEP 2: Code Along
// Type every example yourself

// STEP 3: Modify
// Change examples and see what happens

// STEP 4: Build
// Create small projects using the concept

// STEP 5: Teach
// Explain it to someone else or write about it
3. Project Development Strategy
Start small - Don't build Facebook in day 1

Incremental features - Add one feature at a time

Version control - Use Git for every project

Documentation - Write README for each project

4. GitHub Best Practices for Learning
Commit daily - Even small changes

Meaningful messages - "Add counter functionality" not "update code"

Use branches - feature/todo-app, bugfix/login-issue

Issues tracking - Track your learning goals as issues

5. Building Your Portfolio
Quality over quantity - 3 great projects > 10 mediocre ones

Show progression - Keep early simple projects to show growth

Live demos - Use GitHub Pages for hosting

Detailed READMEs - Explain what you learned

6. Community Engagement
Follow JavaScript developers on Twitter

Join Discord communities

Participate in #100DaysOfCode

Contribute to open source

7. Avoid Common Pitfalls
❌ Tutorial hell - Don't just watch, build!

❌ Jumping to frameworks - Master JavaScript first

❌ Copy-pasting code - Type everything manually

❌ Skipping fundamentals - Strong basics = faster advanced learning

Remember: This GitHub repo is your learning journal. Make it reflect your growth from beginner to confident JavaScript developer! 🚀
